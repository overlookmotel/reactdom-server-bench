# ReactDOM Server benchmark

This repo is a simple (and probably rather naive) benchmark for ReactDOMServer rendering.

Compared are production build of current master (at 20 March 2019) vs with [this PR](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15173).

To run it:

```
yarn install
node index.js
```
